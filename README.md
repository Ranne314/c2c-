# c2cpp - A cross platform tool for converting C to C++ code

## Overview

`c2cpp` is a command-line utility designed to convert C source code files to most C++ standards. It performs syntax replacements, removes redundant `auto` keywords, and creates a new `.cpp` file while keeping the original `.c` file unmodified. This tool ensures compatibility with C++ while retaining most of the original structure and logic of the C code.

## Features

- Converts C code to C++ standards.
- Replaces specific C++ keywords and reserved words with prefixed versions.
- Maintains the original C file and creates a new C++ file.
- Provides help and version information via command-line flags.
